"""initial baseline

Reproduces the canonical schema in ``schema/*.sql`` as the alembic baseline.

The SQL files remain the single source of truth — this revision just executes
them in pipeline order so alembic has a recorded starting point. Existing
production databases will be ``alembic stamp head``-ed on first post-migration
deploy (see WXYC/wxyc-etl#56); the runtime path that drives the pipeline still
applies the SQL files directly.
